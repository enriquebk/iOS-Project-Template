# iOS-Project-Template

This is an iOS project template heavily based on [Xmartlabs's](https://xmartlabs.com) Swift Project Template [repo](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Swift-Project-Template). The main idea behind this template is to be able to quickly start a new iOS project with a lot of built in useful configurations.

## Project Configuration
	
* Three configured targets: App target, Unit Test and UI Tests
* Model View ViewModel - Coordinator architecture
* travis.yml file
* Configured gitignore file
* Swift Lint integration
* Localization and safe string usage using SwiftGen
* Podfile containing popular libraries (RXSwift, RXCocoa, SwiftLint, SwiftGen)
* README.md file with an installation guide and travis and codenv badges 

## Usage

Just open the terminal, go to the project directory and run `swift shell.swift`. The script will ask you some infomation about the project (Project name, bundle Identifier, etc). Once you have entered the requested data, your project will be generated and automatically opened.
